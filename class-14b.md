# What Google Learned About Teams

## Problems with Unhealthy Teams

- Competitive environment
- Posturing prioritized over helpfulness
- Loudest members clumsily control direction while the others are encouraged to remain quiet and apathetic

## Better Teams

- Open-minded environment
- Prioritize creating new ideas and enabling eachother to be more creative and effective
- All members collectively control direction, everyone is encouraged to participate and become invested

## Modern Teambuilding Strategies

- Many untested "truisms"
- Use outdated assumptions about both teamwork and people
- Newer strategies see much improved results

## Google's Perfect Team

- Analytics-driven experimentational strategy to build healthier, more effective team environments
- Previously treated teams as the sum of their parts
- Still believed conventional wisdoms without any proof
- Combined statistics and human sciences to analyze successes and failures of different teambuilding strategies

## Finding patterns

- Google failed to find patterns in demographics, personality combinations, or leadership structures
- Instead, based on decades of various tests, guessed the patterns were in how people interacted
- Found that groups that were conversational, and where all members were equally talkative were more effective
- Teams with higher emotional/social sensitivity were more effective, and less likely to alienate members
- Both of these factors indicated teams where every member is enabled to provide something to the team are more effective
